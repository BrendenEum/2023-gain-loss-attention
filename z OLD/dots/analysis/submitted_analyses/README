This can include a separate directory for each submission.

For example:

```
|_submitted
    |_meuroecon_conference
        |_poster_analyses.R
    |_psych_science
    |_elife
```

where e.g. `poster_analyses.R` would source in functions from `analysis/helpers` and/or `analysis/preprocessing`, data from `data/processed_data`, intermediate outputs (e.g. model fits that take too long to run) from `analysis/outputs` and code snippets from notebooks in `analysis/notebooks`
