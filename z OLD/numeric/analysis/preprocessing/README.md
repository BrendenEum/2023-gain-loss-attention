This is where all scripts for preprocessing would go.  

Scripts in here can be sourced in files in `submitted_analyses>neuroecon_conf>poster_analsyes.R` to help with provenance of data and preprocessing steps in each submission.  

Scripts in here would possibly be written after exploring the data and figure out what to do in interim `notebooks` beforehand.
