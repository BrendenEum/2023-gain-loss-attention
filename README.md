# Eum, Gonzalez, and Rangel (in progress)

A series of three studies that look at the influence of visual attention on
choices amongst negatively-valued options. The first study uses perceptual 
lotteries ("dots"), the second study uses numeric lotteries ("numeric"), and
the third study uses aversive food options ("food").
