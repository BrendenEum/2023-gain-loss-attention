title: "Trying to look at raw ET coordinates in Numeric Study"

We know dots is good.

I want to see if we should be considering a multi-attribute aDDM instead of
treating expected value as value signals. To do this, I need to see if I can
pull the raw eye-tracking data from the study.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
set.seed(4)
library(tidyverse)
library(eyelinker)
rawdatadir = "../../data/raw_data/good/numeric"
```

```{r}
#setwd(file.path(rawdatadir,"201"))
#ascfile <- system.file("201_GainLossTask_gain1.asc", package = "eyelinker")
asc <- read.asc(file.path(rawdatadir,"201/201_GainLossTask_gain1.asc"), samples=F)
str(asc, max.level = 1)
```

```{r}
dplyr::select(asc$info, c(model, mount, sample.rate, cr))
```

```{r}
asc$fix
```
